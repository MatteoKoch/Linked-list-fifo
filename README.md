# Linked-list-fifo
Bad attempt at making my own linked list

When you want to store multiple numbers in memory and you want to use it dynamically the only option usually is a list.
So I attempted making one of those myself to improve my knowledge with C++ pointers (I am a pointer noob).
It is reeeally basic and very slow, but I added some functionality to it nonetheless.
